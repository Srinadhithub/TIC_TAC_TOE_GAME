# TIC_TAC_TOE_GAME
I build this TIC TAC TOE GAME using Java language.In this project I built UI with Java Frames and Java AWT and business logic using core Java,and I used Apache NetBeans to work more effectively on Frames.
Here some of the pictures of game while running.

FUTURE SCOPE

We include features like how many games the player X won and player O won and their score board .
In this project I wrote business logic in same UI class,so due to this it avoids Single Responsibility Rule .So I suggest to seperate the business logic and UI part for more conveneint for reading and reusability of code,easily modifications in further extensions.
